## Upcoming: 2019 OWASP Memphis Development Team Project

Automated Machine Learning Application Pen-Testing Tool: MASE (ML Application Security Engine) Tool

* Designed for Big Data driven applications & Small development team environments.
* Designed to Automate code review and data forensics in big data driven applications. 
* Open Source AppSec tool for today’s applications and big data environments.

### Preview:

MASE utilizes Hadoop, Spark and Storm based tools for outlier and anomaly detection, which are interweave into the system's machine learning and automation engine for real-time fraud detection to forensics, intrusion detection to forensics.
MASE utilizes the Ophidia Analytics Framework as an independent Big Data Multi-Inspection and Forensics node for ongoing high-level or volume code review exceeding local resources.

Additionally, MASE incorporates Lumify, an open source big data analysis and visualization platform to provide big data analysis and visualization of each instances of fraud or intrusion events into temporary, compartmentalized virtual machines that creates a full snapshot of the network infrastructure and infected device to allow an in-depth analytics, forensic review, and provide a transportable threat analysis for Executive level next-steps.

#### Coming Fall 2019 - Full Details will be announced during OWASP Memphis’s 2019 October AppSec Event.
